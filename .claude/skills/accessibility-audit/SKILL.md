# Accessibility audit

Verify behaviour by driving the page. Reading the source tells you what was
intended; pressing Tab tells you what happens.

## Setup

Open the local build. Click once on the page background so focus starts at
<body>, then begin.

## Procedure

### A. Focus order

Press Tab repeatedly and log where focus lands after each press:

\`\`\`js
({
  tag: document.activeElement.tagName,
  name: document.activeElement.ariaLabel || document.activeElement.textContent?.trim().slice(0, 40),
  visible: document.activeElement.getBoundingClientRect(),
});
\`\`\`

Fail conditions: focus order deviates from reading order; focus lands on an
element with zero size; focus escapes to the browser chrome mid-page; a control
is reachable by mouse but not by Tab.

### B. Dialog checklist

Run the whole list for the photo tour, then again for the lightbox:

1. Open with Enter on the trigger (not a click) — does it open?
2. Where did focus go? Query document.activeElement immediately.
3. Tab to the last control, Tab once more — does focus wrap to the first?
4. Shift+Tab from the first — does it wrap to the last?
5. Press Escape — does it close?
6. Where is focus now? It must be the trigger, exactly.
7. Did the page scroll position change? Compare scrollY before and after.
8. While open, is the background inert?
   document.querySelector('main').getAttribute('aria-hidden') or .inert
9. Does the dialog have role="dialog", aria-modal="true" and an accessible
   name? document.querySelector('[role=dialog]').getAttribute('aria-label')
10. Lightbox only: does ArrowRight advance and does the announced position
    update? Check the live region's text, not just the image src.

### C. Contrast

\`\`\`js
function luminance(rgb) {
  const [r, g, b] = rgb.match(/\d+/g).slice(0, 3).map(Number).map((v) => {
    const c = v / 255;
    return c <= 0.03928 ? c / 12.92 : ((c + 0.055) / 1.055) ** 2.4;
  });
  return 0.2126 * r + 0.7152 * g + 0.0722 * b;
}
function ratio(fg, bg) {
  const [a, b] = [luminance(fg), luminance(bg)].sort((x, y) => y - x);
  return +((a + 0.05) / (b + 0.05)).toFixed(2);
}
\`\`\`

Walk every text node's element, resolve its effective background (climb parents
past rgba(0,0,0,0)), and compute the ratio. Thresholds: 4.5:1 body, 3:1 large
text and UI boundaries.

White controls sitting on photographs are the usual failure — they need a scrim
or a shadow, and a measured ratio against the darkest pixel behind them.

### D. Reduced motion

Emulate prefers-reduced-motion: reduce, reload, and repeat section B. Every
state change must still complete; nothing may animate.

### E. Screen-reader sanity

Read the accessibility tree and check that the page makes sense read aloud:
headings describe their sections, buttons say what they do ("Show all 42 photos",
not "Show"), images that carry meaning have descriptive alt text, and decorative
images are alt="".

## Report

Use the table in .claude/agents/accessibility-reviewer.md. Include the exact
key press or query that reproduces each issue. Mark anything you could not verify
as "not verified" rather than assuming it passes.
